    <li> Designing your Plate • In the next few steps you will begin to create your masterpiece which is why you must
      carefully arrange your plate beforehand</li>
    <li>Grab the Bread • Depending on the number of sandwiches you would like, grab either 2 or 4 pieces of bread out of
      the bag and lay them on the plate</li>
    <li> Apply the Condiment • Next, you should apply your desired condiment onto the plain pieces of bread to give the
      ends a rich taste Some examples are: -Mustard -Mayonaise -Ranch -Dressing -Salt and Pepper</li>
    <li>Lay Down the Meat • On top of the previously applied condiment, you should now add your desired meat on both

    <li>More Condiments • Once again another layer of condiments is suggested to spread the flavor throughout the entire
      sandwich</li>
    <li>Toast (If Desired) • If you are looking for a more unique sandwich as opposed to a plain and cold one, you have
      the option to toast it like a Panini • Here you can use a microwave, toaster oven, Panini maker, stove top, or a
